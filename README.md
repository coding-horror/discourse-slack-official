## Configuration

To set up this slack integration, you'll need to create a new slash command and an incoming webhook. You'll use the slash command to subscribe to notifications; Discourse will then send the notifications using the webhook.

1. Go to `https://<your-team>.slack.com/apps/new/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands` to create a new outgoing command.\*

2. Enter the name of the command (eg `/discourse`) and click "Add Slash Command Integration":

    If you have more than one Discourse instance, you need to add add a different slash command for each instance.

3. In the "URL" field, enter the URL that the slash command will post to: `<your-discourse-url>/slack/command`

4. Copy your API token from the "Token" field:

5. Go to your Discourse settings page, found at `<your-discourse-url>/admin/site_settings/category/plugins`. In the left-hand menu, scroll down and click "Plugins". 

6. In the "slack incoming webhook token" field, paste your API token:

    ![Settings Page](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1386403/16739198/f92c6b60-4766-11e6-99b2-877a370f67b5.png)  
    
    You can optionally set the user that Slack will use, and change the size of the excerpts being posted.

6. Now, you need to create the webhook that Discourse will use to post to Slack. You only need to do this once, even if you have multiple  Discourse instances. Go to `https://<yourslack>.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks` and copy the "Webhook URL".

7. Go back to the Discourse settings page. In the "slack outbound webhook url", paste the webhook URL.

8. Select the "Enable the discourse-slack-official plugin" checkbox, and save all the changed settings.

9. In Slack, go to the channel you want to post notifications to, and enter the slash command you set up in step 2. 

  The bot will show you the options for subscribing to notifications:
